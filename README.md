# THB

This repository consists of all my work that I have done during the summer in which I interned at THB Asset Management in Norwalk, CT. Some of my current projects/goals during this internships include developing a website scraping tool that will be able to search through given websites and be able to extract ESG reports. I am going to attempt to do this via a simple tutorial that accepts a company's website URL and then formats the data into a 2D table via Pandas, but hopefully I will be able to create a similar chat-GPT device that, when asked about a particular website, can navigate to the website and pull the desired infromation without the need of a URL from the user. A second task that I will try to do is develop a GUI that enables a user to push a button, enter a text field for desired information and based on the input, queries will be used to output the appropriate result.
